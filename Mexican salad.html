<p></p><center><font face="Andalus">Mexican salad is the well known salad in the 
whole world.The salad sometimes is also known by the name 'Yummy-Yummy'.
The salad's real name is 'Tossed salad.'
It is prepared by tossing the greens and garnishes.A tossed salad uses leafy vegetables
such as lettuce,spinach and fried noodles.<br><br>
It is very important to know that the greens be well dried before tossing.<p></p>
<p>If the leaves are wet,
the dressing won't properly adhere to the greens causing the dressing to become watered
down and generally unenjoyable.The salad can be garnished with many different ingredients
such as nuts,cheese,fruits and chilli sauce.
All kinds of dressing can be used including a light oil and vinegar dressing to a hearty
hot bacon dressing.<br>
Always remember to combine the dressing with the greens at the last possible second.
acid causes most greens to wilt and become soggy.</p></font></center>
